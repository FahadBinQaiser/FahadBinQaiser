# Fahad Bin Qaiser — Frontend Developer

🚀 Self-Taught Developer | React & Tailwind Expert | Co-founder at a Design-to-Code Agency

---

Hi there! I'm Fahad — a frontend developer who turns designs into fast, responsive, and high-converting websites.

I dropped out of college at 17 to pursue real-world learning. Since then, I've been helping entrepreneurs, creators, and brands build their online presence through modern development and seamless UI/UX.

Together with my brother [Faizan Bin Qaiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faizanbinqaiser/), a content and visual designer, I’ve launched a micro-agency where we handle **design + development** — crafting scroll-stopping visuals that _actually convert_.

- 🎯 Create sleek portfolio websites for creators and professionals
- 🔧 Refactor and optimize existing frontend codebases
