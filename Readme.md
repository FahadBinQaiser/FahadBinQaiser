# Fahad Bin Qaiser â€” Frontend Developer

ðŸš€ React & Tailwind CSS Specialist | UI-Focused | Clean Code Advocate

---

I'm Fahad, a frontend developer from the past 2 years.
I started my coding journey on 21 May, 2023.

I specialize in crafting fast, accessible websites using technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. My work is rooted in clean architecture, modular component design, and a strong understanding of user-centric interfaces.

I collaborate closely with visual designers to bring concepts to life â€” translating Figma or brand guidelines into functional, scalable web components.
