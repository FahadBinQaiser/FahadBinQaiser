# Fahad Bin Qaiser — Frontend Developer

🚀 React & Tailwind CSS Specialist | UI-Focused | Clean Code Advocate

---

I'm Fahad, a frontend developer focused on building modern, responsive, and performance-driven web interfaces.

I specialize in crafting fast, accessible websites using technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP. My work is rooted in clean architecture, modular component design, and a strong understanding of user-centric interfaces.

I collaborate closely with visual designers to bring concepts to life — translating Figma or brand guidelines into functional, scalable web components.
